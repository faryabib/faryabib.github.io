Dr. Robert B. Faryabi is an Assistant Professor of [Pathology](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/) and a member of the [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/). After a postdoctoral training with Dr. Andre Nussenzweig at the NIH [Laboratory of Genome Integrity](https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Genome-Integrity), he joined the [Perelman School of Medicine](http://www.med.upenn.edu/) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/) in the June of 2015. The focus of his lab is to explore the genome-wide signatures of replicative stress and their contributions to hematological malignancies.

High-throughput measurement technologies have made it possible to gather systems-level genomics, epigenomics, and functional genomics data on normal and perturbed cells. Our goal is to elucidate the role of DNA replication and repair pathways in tumor initiation, evolution and adaptation. We employ a combined experimental-computational approach, and develop computational methods based on combinations of big data analytics, mathematical modeling and machine learning algorithms to integrate and interrogate high-dimensional experimental data sets.
