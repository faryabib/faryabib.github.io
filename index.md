Dr. Robert Babak Faryabi is an Assistant Professor of [Pathology and Laboratory Medicine](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/) and a member of the [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/). After a postdoctoral training with Dr. Andre Nussenzweig at the NIH [Laboratory of Genome Integrity](https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Genome-Integrity), Dr. Faryabi joined the [Perelman School of Medicine](http://www.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/) in June of 2015. The focus of his lab is to explore the genome-wide signatures of replicative stress and the contributions of replication stress-induced genomic lesions to hematological malignancies.

High-throughput measurement technologies have made it possible to gather systems-level genomics, epigenomics, and functional genomics data on normal and perturbed cells. The goal of Faryabi Lab is to elucidate the role of DNA replication and DNA repair pathways in tumor initiation, evolution and adaptation and leverage this knowledge to develop more effective diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics for human cancer. To acheive this goal, the lab employs a combined experimental-computational approach, and develop computational methods based on combinations of big data analytics, mathematical modeling and machine learning algorithms to integrate and interrogate high-dimensional experimental data sets.
