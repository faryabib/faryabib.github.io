Our lab focuses on understanding the mechanism of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer. We are particularly interested in elucidating how oncogenic signals such as Notch contribute to tumor pathogenicity through regulating its epigenetic program, and to leverage this mechanistic understanding for improved treatments. 

The lab mainly studies cancers with frequent mutations in Notch receptor families. We use combination of wet and dry techniques to understand how oncogenic Notch drives regulatory program in these tumors. Our lab benefits from various established data-rich assays and combine them with novel technologies such as [HiChIP](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n11/full/nmeth.3999.html) and [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/) to elucidate the mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation in Notch-driven tumors at both population and single cell levels.

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">We are always looking for passionate individuals who are interested in investigating cancer epigenomics using combination of experimental and computational approaches.</span><strong>   
   
Rotation students and postodcs could use wet and/or dry approaches to investigate the impact of epigenetics heterogeneity in tumor biology. Read about our [research](research.html) and checkout [here](positions.html) if you are interested in joining our team or doing rotation in the lab. 

Rotation Projects:
+ How does an oncogene reorganize tumor three-dimensional genome?
+ What are the tumor-specific drivers of long-range regulatory circuitry?
+ How does long-range regulatory circuitry can be used to target non-druggable oncogenes?
+ How does epigenetic plasticity drive resistance to targeted therapies?

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">In collaboration with Dr. Vahedi's lab, we stablished a weekly [journal club](https://github.com/VahediLab/ComputationalJournalClub/blob/master/Schedule.md) as an open venue for discussing everything genomics. Join us on Fridays at 4 pm at the BRB305 to share your experience with the application of cutting-edge technologies in biology and have a beer or two!</span><strong>
