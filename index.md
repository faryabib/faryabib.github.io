We are a computational biology lab with focus on cancer epigenomics. Our research spans the areas of cancer biology, computational biology and machine learning. The overarching goal of our lab is to explore how oncogenic cell receptors signaling dysregulate regulome and connectome of tumors and understand their consequences in tumor development and maintenance.

The lab is specifically interested in cancer types with frequent mutations in Notch receptor families. We use combination of wet and dry techniques to understand how oncogenic Notch drives regulatory program in these tumors. Our lab benefits from combination of various established data-rich assays with novel technologies such as [HiChIP](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n11/full/nmeth.3999.html) and [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/) to elucidate the mechanisms of regulome and connectome dysregulation in Notch-driven tumors at both population and single cell levels.

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">We are always looking for passionate individuals who are interested in investigating cancer epigenomics using combination of experimental and computational approaches.</span><strong>   
   
Rotation students and postodcs could use wet and/or dry approaches to investigate the impact of epigenetics heterogeneity in tumor biology. Read about our [research](research.html) and checkout [here](positions.html) if you are interested in joining our team or doing rotation in the lab.

+ Thomas Campbell started his rotaion at the first week of May 2017.

+ Ben Kahn and Rohan Alur joined the lab for their independent studies in February 2017. Welcome Ben and Rohan.

+ The lab received the Cooper Scholar Fund from the [Abramson Cancer Center's](https://www.pennmedicine.org/cancer). 

+ Our Penn Epigenetics Pilot Grant was renewed till 2018. Thanks [The PENN Epigenetics Institute](https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/epigenetics/)!

+ Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics [(ITMAT)](http://www.itmat.upenn.edu/) supported our proposal for single cell epigenomics study of Leukemia.

+ After more than a year researching in the lab, Yeqiao Zhao was admitted to the Genetics & Epigenetics PhD program at UPenn. Congratulations Yeqiao!

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">In collaboration with Dr. Vahedi's lab, we stablished a weekly [computational journal club](https://github.com/VahediLab/ComputationalJournalClub/blob/master/Schedule.md). It is an open venue for everything genomics. Join us on Fridays at 5 pm in the BRB305 to discuss computational biology and have a beer or two!).</span><strong>
