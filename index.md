Our lab focuses on understanding the mechanism of epigenetics dysregulation in cancer. Our specific goal is to elucidate how oncogenic signals such as Notch contribute to tumor pathogenicity through regulating its epigenetic program, and to leverage this mechanistic understanding for improved treatments. 

The lab is specifically interested in cancer types with frequent mutations in Notch receptor families. We use combination of wet and dry techniques to understand how oncogenic Notch drives regulatory program in these tumors. Our lab benefits from various established data-rich assays and combine them with novel technologies such as [HiChIP](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v13/n11/full/nmeth.3999.html) and [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/) to elucidate the mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation in Notch-driven tumors at both population and single cell levels.

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">We are always looking for passionate individuals who are interested in investigating cancer epigenomics using combination of experimental and computational approaches.</span><strong>   
   
Rotation students and postodcs could use wet and/or dry approaches to investigate the impact of epigenetics heterogeneity in tumor biology. Read about our [research](research.html) and checkout [here](positions.html) if you are interested in joining our team or doing rotation in the lab.

<strong><span style="background-color:rgb(230, 230, 255)">In collaboration with Dr. Vahedi's lab, we stablished a weekly [computational journal club](https://github.com/VahediLab/ComputationalJournalClub/blob/master/Schedule.md). It is an open venue for everything genomics. Join us on Fridays at 5 pm in the BRB305 to discuss computational biology and have a beer or two!).</span><strong>
