* [R. Babak Faryabi](PBabak.html), PhD, MSc

* [Yeqiao Zhou](https://twitter.com/YeqiaoZhou) is a PhD candidate at the Genetics and Epigenetics Graduate Group. She is interested in elucidating causes and consequences of genome misfolding in cancer. 

* [Gregory Schwartz](https://github.com/GregorySchwartz) joined the lab after his doctoral training at the Drexel University. Gregory interests lies in developing computational methods to integrate and interrogate high-dimensional experimental data sets using graph theory and machine learning. Dr. Schwartz research has been support by NIH T32 Immunobiology of Normal and Neoplastic Training Grant. 

* Jingru Zhao is a Cell and Molecular Biology PhD student. She works on optical mapping of genome folding in breast cancer. 

* [Aanchal Mongai](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/aanchalmongia) joined the lab after her doctoral training at the IIIT Delhi. Aanchal develops machine learning algorithms for the analysis of spatial genomics data.

* Ashkan Bigledi joined the lab as a PhD student after his training in bioinformatics at Harvard. Ashakan is specialized in developing clinical sequencing workflows and researches pathogenic mutation prioritization.

* David Wilkes joined the lab after his undergraduate studies in biology at Penn State Abingron. In addition to managing the lab, David is pursuing his Master's degree in cell biology at the Jefferson University.

* Brent Perlman is UPenn Vagelos Scholar undergraduate. Brent studies impact of transcription factors on loop extrusion.
