* [R. Babak Faryabi](PBabak.html), PhD, MSc

* [Yeqiao Zhou](https://twitter.com/YeqiaoZhou) is a PhD candidate at the Genetics and Epigenetics Graduate Group. She is interested in elucidating causes and consequences of genome misfolding in cancer. 

* [Gregory Schwartz](https://github.com/GregorySchwartz) joined the lab after his doctoral training at the Drexel University. Gregory interests lies in developing computational methods to integrate and interrogate high-dimensional experimental data sets using graph theory and machine learning. Dr. Schwartz research has been support by NIH T32 Immunobiology of Normal and Neoplastic Training Grant. 

* Bo He join the lab after his training at the City of Hope National Medical Center in cancer epigenetics. Bo is interested in understanding mechanisms of locus specific chromatin folding in Notch-mutated cancers. 

* Ashkan Bigledi joined the lab as a PhD student after his training in bioinformatics at Harvard. Ashakan is specialized in developing clinical sequencing workflows and researches pathogenic mutation prioritization.

* Brent Perlman is a student at Vagelos Program in Life Sciences & Management. He works on analysis and visualization of chromatin conformation data sets.

* Jingru Zhao is a Cell and Molecular Biology PhD student. She works on optical mapping of genome folding for her rotation project.
