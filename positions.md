We use advanced linear and 3D genomic approaches and other molecular biology techniques to elucidate how oncogenic transcription factors reorganize and misfold cancer epigenomes. The lab has open positions for graduate students and postdocs who are interested in tackling these fun and challenging problems. 

* **Molecular biology Postdoc and graduate students**: Individuals with interest in investigating the 3D genome organization of lymphoma and/or breast cancers using genomics approaches. He/she will use population and/or single-cell based assays to elucidate how oncogenic Notch regulates cancer epigenomes. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with ChIP-seq, chromatin conformation capture, and 3D DNA FISH technologies in addition to basic molecular biology assays.    

* **Computational biology Postdoc and graduate students**: Individuals with interest in computational biology are invited to join us to develop approaches and algorithms for integration and interrogation of chromatin state and DNA folding datasets generated in the lab. The objective our computational studies is to precisely identify how oncogenic Notch and its partners control cancer epigenomes. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with analysis of epigenomic datasets and knowledge of programming in R and Python (or Haskell).

Our lab is part of the [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/), [Penn Epigenetics Institute](https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/epigenetics/program-members/), and Penn Institute of Biomedical Informatics](http://upibi.org/). These organizations provide ample opportunities for collaboration and scientific exchange with a large community of translational and basic scientists.   

Applicants are encouraged to contact Dr. Faryabi directly to enquire about the details of existing projects and opportunities.
