We use combination of wet and dry approaches to elucidate how an oncogenic signaling reorganizes tumor epigenome. The lab has open positions for graduate students and postdocs who are interested in tackling these fun and challenging problem using combination of experimental and computational approaches. 

* **Wet lab Posdoc**: a candidate with interest in investigating the 3D genome organization of lymphoma and/or breast cancers using genomics approaches. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with chromatin immunoprecipitation, and sequencing technologies in addition to basic molecular biology techniques. She/he will use population and/or single cell sequencing techniques to elucidate how an oncogenic signaling shapes the organization of tumor genome. Our team closely collaborate with the member of [Pear's lab](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/department/people/481/warren-s-pear).   

* **Dry lab Postodc:** a candidate with interest in computational biology will develop new algorithms to process and integrate data sets characterizing different aspects of tumor epigenome. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with epigenomic and genomic methods and knowledge of programming in R, Python (or C/C++) and SQL.

We are part of the [Center for Personalized Diagnostics](http://www.pennmedicine.org/personalized-diagnostics/), [Penn Institute of Biomedical Informatics](http://upibi.org/), and [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/). This provides ample opportunities for collaboration and scientific exchange with a large community of translational and basic scientists.Our team closely collaborate with the member of [Pear's lab](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/department/people/481/warren-s-pear).   

Applicants are encouraged to contact Dr. Faryabi directly to enquire about the details of existing projects and opportunities.
