We use combination of wet and dry approaches to elucidate how an oncogenic signaling reorganizes tumor epigenome. The lab has open positions for graduate students and postdocs who are interested in tackling these fun and challenging problems using combination of experimental and computational approaches. 

* **Wet lab Posdoc and graduate students**: Individuals with interest in investigating the 3D genome organization of lymphoma and/or breast cancers using genomics approaches. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with chromatin immunoprecipitation, and sequencing technologies in addition to basic molecular biology techniques. He/she will use population and/or single cell sequencing techniques to elucidate how an oncogenic signaling shapes the organization of tumor genome.   

* **Dry lab Postodc:** Individuals with interest in computational biology will develop new algorithms to process and integrate data sets characterizing different aspects of tumor epigenome. He/she will integrate data sources measuring chromatin state and 3D organization with functional data sets to chart the effects of oncogenic signalings on tumor epigenome both at bulk and single cell levels. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with epigenomic and genomic methods and knowledge of programming in R, Python (or C/C++), and SQL.

Our lab is part of the [Center for Personalized Diagnostics](http://www.pennmedicine.org/personalized-diagnostics/), [Penn Institute of Biomedical Informatics](http://upibi.org/), and [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/). These organizations provide ample opportunities for collaboration and scientific exchange with a large community of translational and basic scientists. Specifically, we closely collaborate with the members of [Pear's lab](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/department/people/481/warren-s-pear).   

Applicants are encouraged to contact Dr. Faryabi directly to enquire about the details of existing projects and opportunities.
