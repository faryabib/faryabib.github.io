The lab has open positions for graduate students and postdocs who are interested in solving fun and challenging questions in cancer epigenomics using combinaton of experimental and computational approach. 

We are part of the [Center for Personalized Diagnostics](http://www.pennmedicine.org/personalized-diagnostics/), [Penn Institute of Biomedical Informatics](http://upibi.org/), and [Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute](http://www.afcri.upenn.edu/). This provides ample opportunities for collaboration and scientific exchange with a large community of translational and basic scientists.

* Individuals with interest in dry lab approaches should have background in computational biology, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, or physics. They will optimize and/or develop new analytical approaches to understand epigenomics dysregulation in tumors. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with epigenomics and genomics methods and knowledge of programming in R, Python (or C/C++) and SQL.

* Individuals with interest in wet and dry lab projects should have background or interest in epignenomics and genomics technologies. Preferred but not required qualifications are experience with chromatin immunoprecipitation, and sequencing technologies. They will use population and/or single cell sequencing techniques to investigate the mechanism of development and resistance in tumors driven by oncogenic Notch signaling. These individuals will closely collaborate with the member of [Pear's lab](http://pathology.med.upenn.edu/department/people/481/warren-s-pear).   

Applicants are encouraged to contact Dr. Faryabi directly to enquire about the details of existing projects and opportunities.
